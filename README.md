* [Resume of 2019](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D8D1N0wuCMJyQsq5Z7_SVLk7exKTyh4H/view?usp=sharing)


3rd-year Cognitive science major at Simon Fraser University. VP of Cognitive Science Student Society. Interested in Machine Learning, Big Data Analytics, Feature Engineering (cybersecurity & health care), Financial Forecasting, Anomaly Detection (CyberSecurity-detection), and Embedded Systems for Automation.

Currently in a grad-level ML course, [CMPT 419/726: Machine Learning](https://coursys.sfu.ca/2020sp-cmpt-726-x1/pages/), with a reasearch project and presenation. Class runs from 01/2020 - 04/2020

> Also interested in general software development, in particular to following topics: Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Backend-end web development (Server and APIs), Android, Low level programming, and working with EEG (brain waves) and itâ€™s associated signal processing  

Research Interests: Predictive modeling of Human behavior


# Personal Projects - currently:

## Deep learning
* [The "MNIST" of Brain Digits; Given the brain signal(s) of 2 seconds each, captured with the stimulus of seeing a digit (from 0 to 9) and thinking about it, determine what the digit is](https://github.com/alik604/mnist_brain)
* [CMPT 419/726: Machine learning - Group project (Time Series Prediction)](https://github.com/alik604/cmpt-419)
   + I am able to do all the NNs in the repo.
* Time series prediction (On going for 20 months)
   + _Statistical:_ ([ARIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average) and [Holt winters](https://grisha.org/blog/2016/01/29/triple-exponential-smoothing-forecasting/))
      + [more is the 'ml baselining' notebook here](https://github.com/alik604/cmpt-419)
   + [Mathematical Finance ](https://github.com/alik604/mathematical-finance)

## [openCV object detection](https://github.com/alik604/OpenCV-projects)
All my [OpenCV-projects](https://github.com/alik604/OpenCV-projects) were made over reading break 2019
1. Find an Ali. Used this [educational source](https://pythonprogramming.net/haar-cascade-face-eye-detection-python-opencv-tutorial/?completed=/mog-background-reduction-python-opencv-tutorial/)
   - Facial recognition using a [HAAR cascade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar-like_feature) (Very basic)
2. License Plate OCR
   + Given an image of a License plate, Output all the text found.
   + I failed to process the image in a way such that pyTesseract-OCR will work.

## SFU Robotics Club
* [I made the website: http://sfuskynet.ca/](http://sfuskynet.ca/)
  + [repo](https://github.com/alik604/sfuskynet)
* Code review for the movement system for Robots (7 in total; same code on all but one)

## Web Development
* [Stock watch list and simulator](https://github.com/alik604/stockApp)
* [Online chat](https://github.com/alik604/fullStack/tree/master/ChatIO-online-chat-app)
  + [Deployed here](http://whispering-island-50637.herokuapp.com/?)
* [SFU Robotics Club website: http://sfuskynet.ca/](http://sfuskynet.ca/)
  + [repo](https://github.com/alik604/sfuskynet)
* Torrent client in Node.js
   + This is something I've been wanting to do since the end of high school. I it found too intimidating. Now that there are better resources online, I took another shoot at it.  
   + I learned from examples [1](https://github.com/allenkim67/allen-torrent), [2](https://github.com/marti-1/bittc)

## Android
* [99 names of God](https://github.com/alik604/Android/tree/master/theNamesOfAllah)
