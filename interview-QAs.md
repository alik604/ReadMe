### Tell me a little about yourself

I am a 3nd year Cognitive science major, with a background in ML and cyber-sec. I did first year comp sci, then transfer into SFU cog sci, became VP for the cogs student society. 

I am interested in applying ML to security, biomed-imaging, marketing... or whatever the business demands

I am currently working on the mnist-brain dataset, and taking a researched based ML course 

last week, I was offered a volunteer position at the machine learning and data mining lab,  

This month I’ve went to NWHacks2020, CCDC and my team won 2nd, the other SFU team won 3rd place

### What are your weaknesses?

working with poor documentation for non-code products (nessus scanner config)

### **Describe your ideal role**

a place where my work is stimulating and challenging, I don’t like to lay around doing nothing. ideally flexible hours, so a can work 6h one day, and 10h the next... life doesnt like 8h days very much. 



**Can you explain why you’ve bounced around to many different types of roles (in unrelated areas)?**

prevents burnout. Trust me, i’m a cogs major :)    

*  I’ve heard google does this for the same reason.
